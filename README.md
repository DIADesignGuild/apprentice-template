# Welcome to the DIA Design Guild Apprentice Program!
It's great to have you on board and I hope that you will use this space to keep track of your apprenticeship. This is a private repo and we will use this to track your progress throughout the apprentice duration. 

## Expectations
As an apprentice, you are in charge of your apprentice plan, keep track of your progress, initiate commnication with your mentor, and do the work. The mentor's primary responsibility is to serve as a guide/coach who will help you along the way. 

Apprentices are expected to get to know the other apprentices via the DIA Design Guild Discord server and attending SGVUX monthly events. 

### Meetings
You and your mentor should meet weekly or biweekly to discuss your progress, get project feedback and direction, and career advice. 

This apprenticeship program is at your own pace. You can spend as much time and as little time as you want. 

### Apprentice Plan
Your apprentice plan should include the following: 
- short-term and long-term apprenticeship goals and success criteria
- how you currently expect to accomplish your goal
- why you are interested
- how a mentor can help you

## Onboarding

## Offboarding
You can choose to end your involvement as an apprentice at any time. We hope that our efforts and energies translate into good relations and encourage you to pay it forward, hopefully as a mentor yourself within the DIA Design Guild and even in the larger design community.
